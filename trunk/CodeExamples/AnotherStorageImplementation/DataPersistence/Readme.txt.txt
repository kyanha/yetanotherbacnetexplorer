TODO

This shows how data persistence could be implemented using a much more powerfull
serializer than the one included in the .Net framework : 
	JSON.NET
	by Newtonsoft

Basic serializer cannot handle the polymorphism and generic class used in
AntoherStorageImplementation, code by Newtonsoft yes !

See Programs.SaveAndRestoreBackSample
Make a reference to Newtonsoft.Json.dll
