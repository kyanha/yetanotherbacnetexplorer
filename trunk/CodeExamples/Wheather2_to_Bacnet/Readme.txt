This program (windows service or console) gets current weather data
from WeatherUnlocked Internet Webservice and 'sends' them on Bacnet.

You must first creates a user account into https://developer.weatherunlocked.com/
in order to get an AppId & Key : see https://developer.weatherunlocked.com/signup
It's free of charge for basic services.

You have to modify and add information into the registry : have a look to 
the .Reg file (AppId, UserAccessKey, Latitude, Longitude must be modified).
Latitude, Longitude with no more than 3 decimal places.

On an old Win32 only PC, removes Wow6432Node from the .reg file entry :
	[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Weather2_to_Bacnet]
	changes by
	[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Weather2_to_Bacnet]

This .reg file should be registered by a double click.

To use it as a console application just run the application.

To register the Windows service : in an admin console type :
	installutil.exe Wheather2_to_Bacnet.exe
installutil is located on Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\V4xxxx

then start manually the service or reboot the pc


The code could be simply ported to Linux-Mono :
	removes the 3 lines of code concerning services in the Main method
	hard code (for instance) the 4 parameters : UserAccessKey ...
	removes the inheritence between MyService and ServiceBase
	removes MyServiceInstaller class

Weather2 was the service name before 1st March 2018: application name is unchanged.
