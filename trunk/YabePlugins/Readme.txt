			               Yabe Plugins
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Plugins are compiled as Dll files and should be put close to Yabe.exe.
This allows users to adds private fonctionnalities & menus to Yabe (but C# knowledge is mandatory).

The settings parameter 'Plugins' should give the list of all plugins (names only without '.dll')
separated with a , or a  ;


CheckReliability
	First plugin (based on an idea of Alexander Jaszkowski) to shows how to make it. 
	It check all objects in the selected device and displays all of them when the reliability 
	property value is not 0 (No Fault detected).





A usefull plugin by yourself, not too much dedicated to your application (or customizable), send it,
I'will add it.
